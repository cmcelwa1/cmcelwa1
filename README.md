### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is a project that was built around usage of the Google Books API. This helped to enhance my skills consuming and understanding APIs as well as DOM manipulation using JQuery. The Mustache.js templating engine was used to dynamically render objects that are returned from a search of the API.
